h1. Validates Non Gibberish Of

h3. Written by Brandon Keene <bkeene AT gmail DOT com>

An ActiveRecord style validation method to prevent non-sensical or non-word
content from being saved.

"Gibberish" is a vague term, but basically this method guards against text that
contains too little whitespace, too many consecutive characters, excessive
punctuation, etc.  It works for about 80% of the cases.  Anything more complex
should be handled by some kind of Bayesian classifier, but that might be 
overkill for simple applications.
